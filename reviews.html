					<h1>Reviews</h1>


					<p><img height="100px" src="images/Keira.jpg" alt="Keira">Mr. Aaron Williams is AWESOME! He helps you pass the test AND become a happy safe driver for life. Here's why you should think twice before considering other services or bootstrapping with friends/family:
						1. He'd been a seasoned driver skill test officer before, so he knows exactly what you need to do/not do to PASS THE TEST (note: not merely how to drive)
						2. He will be very professional, extra patient, fun and nice with you until you fully understand every move (your friends and family members may think they can do better at that, until they get into the passenger seat...)
						3. There are so much more about life that you can learn from Mr. Williams - other than passing the test and becoming a happy safe driver. It's like getting a positive energy therapy session AND driver's skills training at the same time - you get a lot more than you thought you were paying for!

						Last but not least, for all the parents looking for a service for your kids - Mr. William's training car has all the safety brake and stuff installed to keep all SAFE during the training, and it's always CLEAN. - Keira P.</p>
					<p><img height="100px"src="images/Kimberly.jpg" alt="Kimberly">Aaron Williams is a one of a kind person! Not only is he extremely funny he is also incredibly attentive to his students needs! Aaron will help you conquer your fears and accomplish goals every step of the way! Aaron Williams is truly gifted in what he does as a teacher along with his one of a kind personality!
					Thank You! By the way Drive Central is the school to pick!!!! - Kimberly C.</p>
					<p><img height="100px"src="images/Moira.jpg" alt="Moira">Mr. Aaron was a wonderful teacher!

						He told me that 90% of his students pass the test on their first try if he thinks they have taken enough classes (most people are good to go in three). I passed with a perfect score on my first try! I was really nervous to drive but his courses really paid off. I wanted to do extra work in a few areas and he spoke honestly with me about what he thought I did and didn't need. I look forward to going out onto the highway for the first time with him.

						He doesn't try to over-sell you on classes and I feel that he was efficient and honest. He knows what it takes to pass the test and the rest is up to you! Also, when he says to watch the video modules he has on his website, you should- they really help.

						Also, it is mega difficult to get a PennDOT driving test appointment (they book 5 weeks in advance IF you can get a slot- be ready to wake up at 3:30am on a Wednesday) so you may even consider booking your test appointment right before you start your lessons with Mr. Aaron. - Moira N.

					<p><img height="100px"src="images/Vanessa.jpg" alt="Vanessa">Aaron Williams is so amazing at what he does that it makes me wish I had never given out a five-star review before, so that people who read this could truly get the full impact of what an impeccable service he provides.

					Aaron is patient, clear, methodical and professional. I myself work as an educator and so his careful attention to pedagogical detail made that much more of an impression on me. He uses a number of different modalities to get information across--videos, written instructions, diagrams, in-car demonstrations, and of course spoken instruction.

					Coming from a family of non-drivers, driving is not something that came to me as second nature, and I tried other driving schools before turning to Drivecentral. Aaron was absolutely the best and most well-organized of the teachers I've worked with. I also had a problem with nervousness and Aaron gave me a lot of positive reinforcement to build my confidence.

					His technique for parallel parking is different from various ways I'd been taught to do it by other people, and it more or less immediately made me go from someone who was not great at parallel parking to someone who can get the car into the space every single time.
